# YouTube-Link-Extractor

This code will take a channel and extract it's channe ID url that looks like "https://youtube.com/channel/UCBR8-60-B28hp2BmDPdntcQ" instead of something like "https://www.youtube.com/@YouTube"

It does not yet support video URL's but it will in the future. 

Install these things with `pip install <name>` to have it work
